                        Designed a new structure for high impact metadata and wrote Python scripts that converted the newly structured metadata into it's previous form. The goal of this new structure was to decrease the tendency towards merge conflicts for over 100 engineers modifying the metadata annually. I added the Python scripts within an existing code base and properly tested the validity of the converted metadata by using existing unit tests and creating my own. I worked with my Senior Software Developer mentor to improve my code in order to be reviewed by Principal Engineers and added to the code base.

Tested multiple tools, including CosmosDB and Gephi, before deciding to use the industry leader in graph visualizations: Neo4j for the graph analysis.

                        Created an HTML5 GUI using Polymer Webcomponents and a Node.js webserver from scratch to create XML files used to customize the health analyses performed by the Intel Cluster Checker. I received recognition for my intern project presentation from upper management and for providing valuable contributions to the Cluster Checker team. With my internship ending later than the majority of students attending schools on the semester system, I presented much earlier than the end of my internship, and was able to incorporate the work of one of the phD interns into my project to add the capability of generating CLIPS rules with my GUI.

I wanted to become a tutor for student-athletes becuse I noticed as I was tutored myself that there was a low supply of tutors available to tutor mathematics classes. My goal as a PLF is to get more student-athletes into STEM by helping them pass lower-division math classes and gain confidence in their ability to learn and challenge themselves.
